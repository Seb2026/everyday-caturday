          Studies have shown that cats have a calming effect on their owners,
          from the soothing action of petting to purring being an aid in falling
          asleep. Cat owners can reduce tensions by just stroking their furry
          friendâ€™s head. Petting a cat releases endorphins into the brain, which
          makes you happier. Also, cats have the softest fur! Cats can even play
          a part in lowering your blood pressure and risk of a heart attack. One
          10-year study has even shown that cat owners were 30% less likely to
          die of a heart attack or stroke than non-cat owners.
